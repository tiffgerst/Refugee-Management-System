Each class has it's own file

If a class needs to be used it gets imported at the top of the page

main.py is for creating instances

test.py is for creating random objects to test functionality

CSV files are used to import/export to/from a database. It is useful for reporting (e.g. pandas)

All properties need to be protected: use decorators - @property, @name.setter (Getters and Setters made simpler)
